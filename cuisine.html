                <h2>Arroz e Chouriço</h2>
                <p>
                    The Goan churico is the Portuguese cousin of the world-renowned Spanish sausage. The Indian and  Portuguese influences are strongly evident, with pork being the preferred meat of choice.<br> The sausages are flavored with vinegar, garlic, hot chili peppers, and spices such as turmeric, cumin, ginger, and cinnamon, making it extremely spicy.<br> A trip to the local market in one of the larger towns will bring you to areas singularly dedicated to selling varieties of these sausages. Most varieties use chunks of diced pork rather than the typical ground meat used in sausages.
