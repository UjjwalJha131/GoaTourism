                  Goa is a small state situated on the western coast of India.
                  It was liberated from the rule of Portuguese in 1961 and is
                  considered as the 25th State in the Union of States of India.
                  On 30 May 1987, it became a separate state.<br />
                  Located on the Western Ghats of Konkan, Goa is known as the
                  smallest and the fourth smallest populated state of India. Goa
                  is bounded by Maharashtra to its north, eastern and southern
                  boundaries were formed by Karnataka, while the western coast
                  is formed by Arabian Sea. It is also considered as the richest
                  Indian state.<br />
                  The largest city of Goa is Vasco da Gama while Panaji is the
                  capital. Margao is known as the historic city of Goa that
                  reflects the Portuguese culture. It is because the Portuguese
                  landed here as merchants first and conquered the land in the
                  early 16th century.<br />
                  International and domestic tourists visit this tiny state
                  every year, in a large number. Tourists are attracted to its
                  golden beaches, architecture and places of worship. It is a
                  biodiversity hotspot and is rich in flora and fauna.<br />
                  Goa is known for sharing harmonious relationship among its
                  various religious communities, living peacefully for
                  generations. Goa is regarded as one of the best states of
                  India in terms of investment environment and infrastructure.
