                  Under the Portuguese rule, Portuguese relations with Hindus were not so good, it was during early 19th century Portuguese’s were so patient and co-operate with Hindus here in Bandora, in order to be grateful Hindus built here a temple called “Mahalaxmi” as she is referred to as Goddess of peace.<br>Mahalaxmi is the Goddess of power and strength and is believed to be an incarnation of ‘Adishakti’-the supreme form of power and energy.<br>  The Shaktas- worshippers of Shakti cult, among the Saraswats, worshipped Adishakti in the form of the linga.Many accept Mahalaxmi as Pallavi, their supporting deity, who is believed to have been released when the gods and demons were churning the ocean for amrita the nectar of immortality.<br>  The Saraswats, at the time of their arrival in Goa , were worshippers of ‘Shiva-Shakti’- Shiva being represented by the ‘Linga’, and Shakti as the Goddess. Thus Shri Mahalaxmi was their Goddess and has been worshipped by the Shilahara rulers (750-1030 A.D.) and also the Kadamba Kings of Goa.<br>  This peaceful or Satvika form of devi that shows in the idol at this temple has a unique feature- that she wears linga on her head.This floor has new hall designed for dance and musical activities keeping in mind with festivals. <br> Every side of mandapa’s entrance is designed with the arts of Hanuman who is known God of Monkey and Garoda Vishnu’s vehicle, half eagle half man and the doors are magnificently carved in wood placed with Ganesh on them.

It is also known as the Shri Mahalasa Narayani Temple and is dedicated to the Goddess Mahalasa.<br>  She is worshipped in two distinct traditions. As an independent goddess, she is considered as a form of Mohini - the female avatar of the god Vishnu and is called Mahalasa Narayani.<br>  Mahalasa is also worshipped as the consort of the folk god Khandoba an incarnation of god Shiva. In this tradition she is associated with Parvati, Shiva's wife as well as Mohini.According to the legend, the presiding deity Goddess Mahalasa once appeared to a cattleman on the Sonsada plateau at Verna.<br>  Asked to go and fetch his master by the goddess, the petrified cattleman is said to have tried to escape his difficult situation by lying that the cattle were thirsty and had to be watered.<br>  The goddess is said to have then touched the ground with her ankle ornament creating a spring, which can be seen today as the Lake Nupur. Eventually, only the master's son-in-law could be summoned and was asked by the goddess to construct this Temple at the spot that she appeared.This deity was originally located at a temple in the Salcete taluka.<br>  And then a small temple was built at Verna. Later when Portuguese conquered Goa the temple was again relocated in Mardol next to Shri Santeri Temple. This beautiful temple was constructed in 1567. Its courtyard is dominated by a seven storied deepmal or lamp tower.<br>  A huge 'Deepstambha' made of five metals, which was built in the 17th century. This splendid pillar is 40 feet in height and has 21 rings of a hundred fifty small lamps.<br>  It is thought to be the largest lamp of its kind in India. The lamp is lit on every Sunday evenings. The inner hall of the temple has carvings of the 10 incarnations of Lord Vishnu that have been stunningly painted.<br>  An elaborated silver frame adorns the doorway to the sanctum. The pillars outside the temple are also exquisitely carved. Behind the temple is a large laterite-lined water tank overlooked by a large sacred Peepal tree.Jatra Mahotsav (Magh Mahotsav) is a popular festival celebrated at Mahalasa Temple. <br> Held in February, it is also called the Mardol Jatra. Apart from the Jatra, the Jaiyanchi Puja held in August and the Kojagiri Pornima are two other special occasions.

              <h2>Fort Tiracol</h2>
              <p>
                The Tiracol Fort in Goa, also known as Terekhol Fort, was constructed by Maharaja Khem Sawant Bhonsle then the King of Sawanwadi during 17th century on the top of a Hilllock at northern bank of Tiracol River, which is also located in the close proximity to the Arabian Sea.<br>  The name Tiracol probably derives from the Marathi word tir-khol, which means a “steep bank of river”. The fort is located about 45 km away from the capital city of Panaji, Goa, and a ferry service from Querim is available to reach Tiracol.<br> The fort was captured by Portuguese during (in 1746 AD) their time of ranges in Goa. Suddenly Tiracol Fort becomes an important part of the Portuguese naval defences.<br>  During the time period of Portuguese a church named, St Anthony was constructed and also they reconstructed the fort. Thereafter, the Tiracol Fort was used as a base for freedom fighters during the liberation of Goa in 1961 and the Portuguese lost its control over the fort when India forcibly annexed its territory.<br>  Presently Tiracol Fort has been converted into a heritage hotel.The main attraction of the fort is a lovely scenic view from top on the fort of the Tiracol River and the Arabian Sea.
